        <h1>The killers</h1>
        <p>The Killers are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas in 2001 by Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals). The band went through a number of early lineup changes, but by 2002 they had settled on a lineup of Flowers, Keuning, Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). The band's name is derived from a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band portrayed in the music video for   the New Order song "Crystal".</p>
        <p>The Killers have released seven consecutive chart-topping studio albums.</p>
